### Arduino is **Interactive Device** from "Getting with started with Arduino"

The Interactive Device is an electronic circuit that is able
to **sense** the environment using **sensor**s (electronic
components that convert real-world measurements into
electrical signals). The device processes the **information** it
gets from the sensors with behaviour that's implemented
as software. The device will then be able to interact with
the world using **actuator**s, electronic components that can
convert an electric signal into a physical action.
