### Program Structure

The absolute minimum requirement of an Arduino program is the use of two functions: void setup() and void loop(). The "void" indicates that nothing is returned on execution.

```void setup()``` - this function executes only once, when the Arduino is powered on. Here we define things such as the mode of a pin (input or output), the baud rate of serial communication or the initialization of a library.
```void loop()``` - this is where we write the code that we want to execute over and over again, such as turning on/off a lamp based on an input, or to conduct a sensor reading every X second.
The above functions are always required in an Arduino sketch, but you are of course able to add several more functions, which is useful for longer programs.

### "Sketch"

In the Arduino project, a program is referred to as a "sketch". A sketch is a file that you write your program inside. It has the .ino extension, and is always stored in a folder of the same name.
The folder can include other files, such as a header file, that can be included in your sketch.

### ex. print in monitor window

```
int delayTime = 500;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  Serial.println("Hello, Arduino");
  delay(delayTime);

}
```

### ex. ombine string and print

```
int delayTime = 500;
String name = "BH Lee";

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  Serial.print("Hello, Arduino! ");
  Serial.print("I'm ");
  Serial.print(name);
  Serial.print(".");
  Serial.println("");

  delay(delayTime);

}
```

### ex. area calculation

```
int delayTime = 500;

float pi = 3.14;
float radius = 2.;
float area;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  area = sq(radius) * pi;

  Serial.print("Circle area with radis = ");
  Serial.print(radius);
  Serial.print(" is ");
  Serial.println(area);

  delay(delayTime);

}
```
