```
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW); 
  delay(1000); 
}
```
Arduino cannot run multiple programs
at the same time and programs can't quit. When you
power up the board, the code runs; when you want to
stop, you just turn it off.
