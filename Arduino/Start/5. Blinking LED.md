```
#define LED 13 // LED connected to digital pin 13

void setup()
{
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // sets the digital pin as output
}

void loop()
{
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turns the LED on
  delay(1000); // waits for a second
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turns the LED off
  delay(1000); // waits for a second
}
```
Arduino cannot run multiple programs
at the same time and programs can't quit. When you
power up the board, the code runs; when you want to
stop, you just turn it off.
