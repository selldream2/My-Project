### A Typical Workflow
To upload code to an Arduino board using the IDE, one typically does the following:

1. Install your board - this means installing the right "package" for your board. Without the package, you can simply not use your board. Installing is done directly in the IDE, and is a quick and easy operation.

2. Create a new sketch - a sketch is your main program file. Here we write a set of instructions we want to execute on the microcontroller.

3. Compile your sketch - the code we write is not exactly how it looks like when uploaded to our Arduino: compiling code means that we check it for errors, and convert it into a binary file (1s and 0s). If something fails, you will get this in the error console.

4. Upload your sketch - once the compilation is successful, the code can be uploaded to your board. In this step, we connect the board to the computer physically, and select the right serial port.

5. Serial Monitor (optional) - for most Arduino projects, it is important to know what's going on on your board. The Serial Monitor tool available in all IDEs allow for data to be sent from your board to your computer.
